# NitroDroid Chat App

This is a simple app demo I'd put together for NitroDroid 2013 to accompany my [presentation](//slid.es/arg0s/realtime-android-apps) introducing the basic concepts of Firebase to a beginner audience.

It's a fork of the [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com) chat example with a few tweaks added to add a Goan theme and to grab account user ids for the purposes of the demo.

Feel free to fork and modify as you please. Firebase is awesome, and enjoy building!
